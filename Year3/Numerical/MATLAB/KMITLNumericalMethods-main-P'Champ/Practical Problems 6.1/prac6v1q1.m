%% Practical Problems 6.1 Question 1

% Use the eye function to create a 4 x 5 diagonal matrix 
% called A with 7's on the leading diagonal.

% Create an identity matrix, then scalar multiplication on A with 7.
% Now we can have an identity matrix with the leading (entrance) with 7.
A = 7*eye(4, 5);
